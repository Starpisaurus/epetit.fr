                        <p>
                            Sport enable people to meet people without the language barrier. The way with which people communicate with each other is different in the daily life and in sport. That’s why words are not the most important.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Actions are the most important way to communicate in sport. A victory or a defeat are event that bring a team together because they lose or they win together. In these cases, there is no need to talk; people express their joy or their disappointment. Emotions are what allow people to understand the others even if they are expressing it in an other language. Strategies can be explained, before the game, thanks to illustrations so that it is understood by all the team. During the game, players communicate with each other thanks to gestures or codes. For example, basketball players should only know simple numbers so as the captain team make everyone understand what will be the position and the strategy to use. Even the way to communicate of the referee is understandable without any word. Sound of the whistle is the sign that people hear to know if there is a point or a foul.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Understanding of strategies are facilitated because rules are universals. In one hand, when people have already played a sport in their countries they already know the rules in their own languages so they don’t have to learn them in a language that they don’t know. In the other hand, when people don’t know the sport that they want to play abroad, rules are almost written in all languages so they can find and learn new rules in they own languages. Once at the game everyone will have learned the same rules so as there is no misunderstanding. Reading is not the only way to learn the rules. Practicing and watching are the best ways to learn. When someone is watching someone else playing it is easier to learn rules and strategies by imitation. For example, if someone doesn’t know the rules and goes to see a game, he will understand fast what is the goal and what the players can or cannot do. When the referee whistle, it means that there is a foul and scores are written so it is easy to know when a team has won a point and how is it counted. That is why everybody is able to understand sport regardless of its language speaking.
                        </p>

                            Google is an example of multicultural company so it is crucial that people success in being integrated in their team. Google created a lot of teambuilding to break the social barriers between its employees. In Mountain view google has available bikes, In Seattle employees have kayaks and a place to play football as a team and in Kirkland they have a place for volleyball. Colleagues can see each other as a real team because they train and enjoy their self togather.
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="cons">Con's</h3>
                        <p>
                            Sport is a way to be integrated, but we can see that somehow, some young people are inclined to go away from sport association. In fact, it can be hard to meet and integrate multicultural group of people when joining a team because at some age people are much more inclined to create their own group without the need of being in a sport team. The groups are created per sport level, age, gender and not center of interest. So, it can impede the integration because the only thing that gather people is sport and not values. So, people will be united during the training but after that they have nothing to share. When you are part of a team, you can share valuable moment. For example, when you are in the bus, you can be integrated because you share moment with them, you sing their song and in a way it is a way to be integrated. So, you need to implicate yourself in the club’s life to meet new people, not in a sport way but more with the aim of being friend.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the other limits, is that, if someone is not keen on doing sport, he cannot be integrated in a country where sports is a country matters. No doing sport is not an issue, because you can share with others around sports events without practicing any sports. For example, you can support the country or university team to share the passion of sport with other to meet new people and be integrated in multicultural groups of people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sport’s cost can be a limit, because it can create some social discrimination and even deprive people of doing sport because the cost is way too expensive. To avoid that, one of the recommendation would be to propose for free facilities to all the students of workers if it’s a company.
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            To conclude, doing sport is a way to be integrated, but furthermore, sharing the spirit of sport enable to gather people around one country culture. So, if you are not an athlete you can integrate yourself by sharing sports values with multicultural group because what gather people is all the value around sport like supporting your team university, going to baseball match in the US. You don’t even need to be keen on sport because what people like is to share their passion. So, go ahead, share people’s passion, give interest to them and they will accept you and integrate you in their groups even if you are abroad and you don’t talk or understand their language.
